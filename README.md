# Renumber
#This script was built for the need to organize filenames from a directory, in my case it was pictures from a wedding.

#Some times we have tons of pictures that at some point had an order but overtime we delete some, creating jumps in between file names,
#this will be helpful renumbering those files.

#This script can easily be modified to change the whole file name, instead of keeping the file basename as it is currently doing now.

#Furthermore, the script goes through each file, collecting the basename and adding a number to it, incrementing the number gradually thorugh a loop.  It also checks for the existence of filenames before replacing them.
